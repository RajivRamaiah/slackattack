# I made a slackbot

See <https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/slackattack> for the intructions...

This is a screenshot of a sample conversation with my bot displaying how help works and how to get food :

This is a screenshot of my bot responding to Hi!:

My bot meets all the requirements for the lab since it wakes up using a webhook if the heroku dyno sleeps, it carries out a conversation to help a user find where to eat using multiple helper methods, and it responds to hi and has a default message if a user types in something it cannot make sense of! It also has help functionality as well. Furthermore, the final message of the food query uses an attachment to format the message nicely for the user!
